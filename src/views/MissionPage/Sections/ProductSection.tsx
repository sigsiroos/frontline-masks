            By increasing the amount of masks and protective gear that our healthcare workers would receive compared to small orders placed within the open market, we can maximize the amount of masks and protective gear that our healthcare workers are receiving.

          <h5 className={classes.description}>
            The Healthcare system and Government are not moving fast enough and weâ€™re trying to get healthcare workers the gear they urgently need. Prices are changing constantly, sea freight is taking too long for supplies which are needed today. Air freight is in limited supply coming from overseas there are a lack of flights due to travel restrictions. This is a multi-layered problem we are trying to solve with healthcare workers caught in the middle. Help us help them.
          </h5>
          <h5 className={classes.description}>
            Due to global demand, there is an abundance of manufacturers whom have popped up overnight to fill the demand, some with inconsistent quality and practices.  All supplies we source are carefully vetted to check certifications and manufacturing sources to confirm they comply with U.S. regulations.  Even with all of that said, there is still a shortage of supplies and the Federal government has eased restrictions to allow protective gear certified from other countries. We have familiarized ourselves with the nuances of these regulations and regulatory bodies and will supply the quality protective equipment our healthcare workers so desperately need.
